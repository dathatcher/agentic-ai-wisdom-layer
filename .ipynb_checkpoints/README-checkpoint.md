# Agentic AI Wisdom Layer: A Simulated Proof of Concept

This repository presents a dynamic, interactive simulation of a **Meta-Agentic AI architecture**, focused on a **Wisdom Layer** composed of cognitive agents that model systems behavior, volatility, ethics, and emergent complexity.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

The Wisdom Layer simulates how **meta-agents**—rooted in Systems Thinking, Chaos Theory, and Karma—can collaborate to detect risk, highlight ethical imbalance, and forecast systemic fragility in sociotechnical systems.

It operates on a JSON-based mental model that can be iteratively evolved by human inputs, telemetry, or functional agents. The goal is to enable not just automation, but **cognition**, **foresight**, and **resilience-awareness**.

> 🚫 **Note:** This project is not yet AI-powered. It is a working simulation of agentic logic using rule-based modeling. The architecture lays the foundation for future integration with AI tools such as LLMs, machine learning pipelines, and agent-based orchestration. This simulation demonstrates that the underlying conceptual framework is robust and extensible.

## 🧩 Agents Included

| Agent                    | Role                                                                 |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Systems Thinking Agent**  | Models graph structure; detects bottlenecks, isolated nodes, and system dependencies |
| **Chaos Theory Agent**      | Uses ripple modeling to propagate volatility across nodes and detect feedback loops |
| **Karma Agent**             | Simulates causal ethics; calculates impact scores and ethical alignment for system actors |
| **Complexity Sentinel Agent** | Detects structural drift and emergent changes across model states (node/edge diffs) |

## ⚙️ Technology Stack

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Streamlit** for interactive dashboard UI
- **NetworkX** for systems graph modeling
- Modular agent logic under `agents/`

## 🚀 Features Added in This Version

- ✅ **Ripple-aware Chaos Theory Agent**  
  Models volatility as an emergent property; propagates chaos through edges using decay factor.

- ✅ **Dynamic Model Ingestion**  
  JSON mental model changes instantly update volatility, ethics, and structural analytics.

- ✅ **Resilience Modeling via Redundancy**  
  Added agent logic to reflect how adding a new actor (e.g. "Alex Rivers") can reduce risk concentration around a single node (e.g. "Jane Doe").

- ✅ **Volatility + Karma Overlay**  
  Shows ethical alignment of high-volatility nodes (e.g., burnout signals).

- ✅ **Complexity Drift Detection**  
  Tracks changes in the system model and visualizes the structural deltas in the dashboard.

## 📘 How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wisdom-layer-poc.git
cd wisdom-layer-poc
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or use venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

Then upload or modify the `systems_model.json` to simulate new scenarios.

---

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

- “What happens if `Datadog` fails and Jane is out of office?”
- “Who in the organization has the highest ethical load and ripple volatility?”
- “If I onboard a new SRE with the same tools as Jane, does system fragility decrease?”
- “What drift occurred in the system after the latest changes?”

## 🧭 Roadmap

Planned features include:
- Functional agents (onboarding, observability, DevOps) feeding Wisdom Layer
- LLM-powered “what-if” forecasting (“what if PayrollApp crashes and Jane is unavailable?”)
- Integration with CI/CD, ticketing, and logging systems
- DSRP-aligned entropy, ripple decay normalization, and memory of volatility shifts
