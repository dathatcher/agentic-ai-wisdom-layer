# Agentic AI Wisdom Layer - Walkthrough

## 🧠 Introduction

This walkthrough supports the simulated proof-of-concept presented in the SSRN paper:

**"Wisdom Before Code: Architecting Agentic AI through Systems Thinking, Chaos Theory, and Karma"**  
📄 [Read on SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5224492)

The Wisdom Layer is not a chatbot, an LLM prompt system, or a pre-trained model — it is a structured thinking framework. This dashboard is a **simulation environment** to show how agentic models can form the foundation of robust, ethical, real-time AI systems.

> Although the current simulation is rooted in an **IT/DevOps organizational domain**, it is designed to be **domain-agnostic**. These principles can apply to any complex adaptive system — from software delivery to democracy, education, healthcare, or supply chains.

You can start small, with just a few nodes and relationships, and grow your model as you go. The Wisdom Layer is built for evolution.

## 🚦 Current Capabilities (Simulation Only)

> ⚠️ **No actual AI is used in this proof-of-concept.** All agents operate via rule-based logic on a simulated JSON model to show how real AI could interact with structured mental models.

### What the System Does:
- Loads a domain model (`systems_model.json`) — this is the Wisdom Layer's "mental model."
- Activates **4 agents** that analyze and visualize the system:
  
| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Systems Thinking | Identifies structure, bottlenecks, isolated nodes |
| Chaos Theory     | Propagates ripple volatility and detects feedback loops |
| Karma Agent      | Simulates ethical load via intention × impact × activity |
| Complexity Sentinel | Detects structural changes across model updates |

### What You See:
- A dashboard (via Streamlit)
- Visual graphs and charts
- JSON output for analysis/debugging

## 📂 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/dathatcher/wisdom-layer-poc`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Launch: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Upload a JSON system model or use the default provided

## 🧪 Sample Interactions (Try This!)

### 🔁 Scenario: Remove Jane Doe
- Before: Jane Doe is a bottleneck (uses Terraform, Jira, involved in releases)
- After: Ripple volatility drops, Chaos chart recalculates
- Karma: Her absence reduces overall positive ethical balance

### ⚠ Scenario: Remove a release event
- Remove `RELEASE-v1.2.0`
- Observe the drop in ripple propagation
- Complexity Sentinel should detect node/edge loss

### 🧠 Add a Redundant Person
- Add a new person: `Alex Rivers` with same tool use as Jane Doe
- Result: Volatility on Jane drops, Chaos equalizes, Karma diversifies

## 🧠 Understanding the Data Layer

The Wisdom Layer relies on a structured JSON model to simulate an evolving mental model of a system. This model includes:

- **People** (e.g., Jane Doe, CI Pipeline)
- **Tools** (e.g., Jira, Jenkins, Datadog)
- **Applications** (e.g., PayrollApp)
- **Servers** (e.g., VM hosts)
- **Teams** (e.g., SRE, DevOps)
- **Events** (e.g., commits, tickets, deployments, releases)

> The **event layer** captures artifacts and actions from humans, tools, and systems — including Jira tickets, GitHub commits, Jenkins builds, etc. These are key indicators of activity, responsibility, and influence across the system.

---

## 🤔 What This Is Really Telling You

You are observing **system-wide interdependencies**, not isolated components.

The Wisdom Layer shows:
- Where fragility hides (e.g., Jane Doe, Datadog, DevOps)
- What creates instability (e.g., release chain reactions)
- How ethical load accumulates (e.g., CI Pipeline vs. Checkly)
- How structure evolves with each JSON update

---

## 🤖 What This Will Become

Once this architecture is matured:
- AI agents (LLMs, ML pipelines, etc.) will use this as their ground truth
- Events will come from real logs, systems, APIs
- Agents will reason *before* acting
- Humans can ask: "What happens if this fails? Who is the bottleneck? Where are we ethically fragile?"

---

## 📌 Closing Note

This simulation is your **first step** toward wisdom-aligned AI. It's not flashy — it's foundational.

Run scenarios. Break things. Visualize consequences.

That’s where intelligence becomes wisdom.
