# Agentic AI Wisdom Layer: A Simulated Proof of Concept

This repository presents a dynamic simulation of a **Meta-Agentic AI architecture**, centered around a Wisdom Layer composed of cognitive agents that model **systems behavior**, **volatility**, **ethical tension**, and **emergent complexity**.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

The Wisdom Layer simulates how **meta-agents**—rooted in Systems Thinking, Chaos Theory, Karma, and Complexity Theory—can collaborate to detect risk, assess ethical load, and forecast systemic fragility in sociotechnical systems.

It operates on a JSON-based mental model that can evolve through human curation or functional inputs. The goal is not just automation, but **cognition**, **foresight**, and **resilience-awareness** in complex adaptive environments.

> ✅ **Note:** This is a partially AI-powered proof of concept. While agent reasoning originated from rule-based modeling, the current version integrates **LLM-powered cognitive agents** (e.g., `smart_prompt()` for Systems Thinking, Chaos Theory, Karma, and Complexity Sentinel). These agents reason on structured JSON-based system models and provide adaptive, explainable insights in real time. This demonstrates a functional **Wisdom Layer**, capable of modeling and interpreting complex system states through AI-enhanced perception.

## 🧹 Agents Included

| Agent                     | Role                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Systems Thinking Agent**   | Detects structure, bottlenecks, isolated nodes, and system dependencies |
| **Chaos Theory Agent**       | Propagates volatility through ripple decay and detects feedback loops  |
| **Karma Agent**              | Calculates ethical load based on intention, impact, and influence       |
| **Complexity Sentinel Agent**| Compares system snapshots to detect emergent changes and drift         |

## 📃 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dathatcher/wisdom-layer-poc.git
cd wisdom-layer-poc
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

> Then upload or modify `systems_model.json` to simulate new scenarios.

## 🔮 Sample Use Cases

- “What if `Datadog` fails while `Jane Doe` is out of office?”
- “Who has the highest ethical load and ripple fragility?”
- “What emergent shifts occurred in model version `v1.3` vs. `v1.4`?”
