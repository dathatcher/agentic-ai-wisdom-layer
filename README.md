# Agentic AI Wisdom Layer: A Simulated Proof of Concept

This repository presents a simulated proof of concept for a **Meta-Agentic AI architecture**, focusing on a **Wisdom Layer** composed of the following cognitive agents:

- **Systems Thinking Agent**: Detects bottlenecks and isolated nodes using systems mapping.
- **Chaos Theory Agent**: Analyzes volatility and feedback loops across components.
- **Karma Agent**: Applies causal ethics by evaluating intention, impact, and deriving a "karma" rating.
- **Complexity Sentinel Agent**: Detects emergent changes and anomalies across evolving graphs.

> ⚙️ This simulation is built using Python and Streamlit. It provides an interactive dashboard that demonstrates how meta-agents can be combined to assess complexity, instability, and ethical alignment across a given organizational or technical system.
